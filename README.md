# Password-Strength-Tool
The app measures the effectiveness of the password given by the user against guessing or brute-force attacks. The app uses JavaScript algorithm scripting and regex to test if the password has more than 8 characters, capital letters, numbers, and special characters. The more complex the password the better score the user gets. The app uses CSS for the design and responsive web developement.
